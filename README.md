# What is it?
"MiROS" is a Minimal Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) kernel for ARM Cortex-M.
It supports preemptive, priortity-based multithreading, fully compliant with
RMA/RMS (Rate-Monotonic Analysis/Scheduling). It is currently written for
ARM/KEIL MDK (uVision), but can easily be ported to other toolchains as well.

MiROS is a teaching aid used in the "Modern Embedded Programming" video course
on YouTube:

The main goal of the MiROS kernel is to illustrate the concepts underlying
Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS). The aim here  is simplicity and clear
presentation of the concepts, but without dealing with various corner cases,
portability, or error handling. For these reasons, the software is generally
NOT intended or recommended for use in commercial\applications.
